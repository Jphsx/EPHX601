first get the code

mkdir pendulum
cd pendulum
git init
git clone

get eclipse Luna from the readme, put it anywhere outside the git directory
cd into the eclipse directory

./eclipse

set workspace path to the cloned directory (EPHX601)
 the path is to ~/EPHX601/

inside eclipse:

File>import>General>ExistingProjectsinWorkspace
 select the dataDisplay directory as the existing project


find the dataDisplay directory project thingy in Project explorer on the left.
its the folder icon that is parent to src, package, and JRE system library
 right click the datatDisplay project thing, scroll to the bottom of the context menu and select properties

In the window that pops up, select Java Build Path on the Left
After you select Java Build Path select the Libraries tab that is over on the right.
There are a cluster of buttons on the right, select Add External JARs

navigate to the jfreechart-1.0.1.9 directory in the project, the jars we need to link to the project are here
the path to the external jars that need to be added is
	~/EPHX601/jfreechart-1.0.1.9/lib/jcommon-1.0.23

after adding jcommon there is one more to add.  Select add external JARs again and get the jar:

	~/EPHX601/jfreechart-1.0.1.9/lib/jfreechart-1.0.1.9

after both are added you should be able to build and run with no errors.

but to use the this program with the other programs in the project, we need to make a runnable jar

export project:  File>Export>Java>runnable Jar file
Launch Configuration: Display - data Display
Export destination:  ~ EPHX601/dataCap.jar overwriting the old dataCap.jar

now the display program will start when the pipeline is initiated
